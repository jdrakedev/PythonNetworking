# FTP (file transfer protocol): An internet tool provided by TCP/IP. 
# Helps to transfer files between computers by providing access to directories or folders on remote computers and
# allows software data text files to be transferred between different kinds of computers.

# The end user in a connection is known as the local host and the server which provides data is known as the remote host.

# FTP is a standard communiction protocol, like HTTP. 

# However, HTTP lacks clarity and focus.
# Moreover, the systems involved in connection are heterogeneous. Meaning that they differ in operating systems, 
# directory structures, character sets, etc.

# On the other hand, FTP shield the user from these differences to transfer data efficiently and reliably.
